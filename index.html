				An updated, modern, and fully functional fork.

		</header>

		<p>Luakit is a highly configurable, browser framework based on the <a
		href="http://webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> web content engine and the <a
		href="http://gtk.org/" target="_blank">GTK+</a> toolkit. It is very fast, extensible with <a
		href="http://lua.org/" target="_blank">Lua</a> and licensed under the <a
		href="https://raw.github.com/aidanholm/luakit/develop/COPYING.GPLv3" target="_blank">GNU GPLv3</a>
		license.  It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people with too much time
		on their hands who want to have fine-grained control over their web browser&rsquo;s behaviour and
		interface.</p>

		<h2 id=sec-features>New Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated to use the WebKit 2 API. This is a critical change, since the older WebKit 1 API that the original Luakit is based on has over two hundred security vulnerabilities that will never be fixed (See <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates/" target="_blank">here</a> for more details).</li>
			<li>Added several new widget types, including overlay and drawing area widgets.</li>
			<li>Improved API and usage documentation.</li>
			<li>Improved test coverage.</li>
			<li>Improved test runner that supports running simulated browsing scenarios.</li>
			<li>Added support for detaching tabs into new windows.</li>
			<li>Added support for vertical tabs.</li>
			<li>Key presses that do not prefix any valid bindings are now ignored. This prevents key bindings like <code>gg</code> being ignored because the input buffer has filled up with garbage.</li>
			<li>Adding a form to the form-filler file now uses visual element selection, similar to the <code>follow</code> mode.</li>
			<li>Added a status bar widget indicating NoScript status on the current page.</li>
			<li>Improved exit-prevention when restarting, quitting via key binding, and quitting via the window manager.</li>
			<li>Added recovery session auto-saving. If Luakit crashes, a recent snapshot of your session can be restored.</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Miscellaneous Changes and Bug Fixes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Removed usage of <code>module()</code> in Lua code.</li>
			<li>Saving and restoring a session now restores the set of closed tabs, allowing you to &lsquo;undo-close&rsquo; them.</li>
			<li>Reopened tabs that were closed in a previous session are now restored in the correct place.</li>
			<li><code>:wqall</code> now saves and closes all windows, not just the current one.</li>
			<li>Idle callback functions that have errors are removed; this prevents error message spam.</li>
			<li>Fixed Lua errors when closing windows with multiple tabs.</li>
			<li>Fixed various bugs in various Luakit chrome pages.</li>
			<li>Completion now works with commands that contain hyphens.</li>

		</ul>

		<h2 id=sec-announcements>Announcements</h2>

		<p>Currently development is still ongoing, and although many parts of
		Luakit are now relatively stable, some parts are in a state of flux.
		This is complicated by the separation of Luakit&rsquo;s Lua code into the
		<code>config/</code> and <code>lib/</code> directories; while
		development changes can be made to Lua modules within <code>lib/</code>,
		occasionally it is necessary to modify Lua code within
		<code>config/</code>. This risks breaking users&rsquo; configuration, as it is
		expected for users to copy files from <code>config/</code> to their home
		directory and modify them as they see fit.</p>

		<p>I am considering ways to mitigate this problem for a variety of common
		use-cases. Currently, however, it is necessary for users to check for
		changes to files in <code>config/</code> whenever they update, and
		manually merge any changes into any modified files.</p>

		<h3>Supported Operating Systems</h3>

		At this point in time, only Linux and similar Unix-like operating systems are supported. I&rsquo;ve only tested Luakit on Linux.

		<h3>Required Dependencies</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.gtk.org/" target="_blank">GTK 3</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://webkitgtk.org/" target="_blank">WebKitGTK+</a> (webkit2gtk)</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank">Lua 5.1</a> or <a href="http://luajit.org/" target="_blank">LuaJIT</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://keplerproject.github.io/luafilesystem/" target="_blank">lfs (Lua File System)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite 3</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Installing</h3>

		<p>
		Arch Linux users can install the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/luakit-git/" target="_blank">luakit-git</a> package from the AUR. Other users will need to download and build from source. Luakit contains only around 9000 lines of code, so this process is usually very fast.
		</p>

		<h3>Downloading The Source</h3>

		<p>
			You can download the latest development version in either
			<a href="https://github.com/aidanholm/luakit/zipball/develop">zip</a> or
			<a href="https://github.com/aidanholm/luakit/tarball/develop">tar</a> formats.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can also clone the project with <a href="http://git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git</a>
			by running: <pre>git clone git://github.com/aidanholm/luakit</pre>
		</p>
		<p>After downloading, full instructions on building and running Luakit are available in the <code>README.md</code> file.</p>
